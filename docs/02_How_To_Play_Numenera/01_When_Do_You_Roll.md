 
Any time your character attempts a task, the GM assigns a difficulty to that task, and you roll a d20 against the associated target number. 

When you jump from a burning vehicle, swing a battleaxe at a mutant beast, swim across a raging river, identify a strange device, convince a merchant to give you a lower price, craft an object, use a power to control a foe’s mind, or use a heat-beam emitter to carve a hole in a wall, you make a d20 roll. 

However, if you attempt something that has a difficulty of 0, no roll is needed—you automatically succeed. Many actions have a difficulty of 0. Examples include walking across the room and opening a door, using a special ability to negate gravity so you can fly, using an ability to protect your friend from radiation, or activating a device (that you already understand) to erect a force field. These are all routine actions and don’t require rolls. 

Using skills, assets, and Effort, you can ease the difficulty of potentially any task to 0 and thus negate the need for a roll. Walking across a narrow wooden beam is tricky for most people, but for an experienced gymnast, it’s routine. You can even ease the difficulty of an attack on a foe to 0 and succeed without rolling.

If there’s no roll, there’s no chance for failure. However, there’s also no chance for remarkable success (in Numenera, that usually means rolling a 19 or 20; see Special Rolls in Chapter 8: Rules of the Game)
