The rules of Numenera are quite straightforward at their heart, as all of gameplay is based around a few core concepts.

This chapter provides a brief explanation of how to play the game, and it’s useful for learning the game. Once you understand the basic concepts, you’ll likely want to reference Chapter 8: Rules of the Game for a more in-depth treatment.

Numenera uses a twenty-sided die (d20) to determine the results of most actions. Whenever a roll of any kind is called for and no die is specified, roll a d20. 

The game master (GM) sets a difficulty for any given task. There are 10 degrees of difficulty. Thus, the difficulty of a task can be rated on a scale of 1 to 10. 

Each difficulty has a target number associated with it. The target number is always three times the task’s difficulty, so a difficulty 4 task has a target number of 12. To succeed at the task, you must roll the target number or higher.

Task Difficulty | Description |Target No. | Fail Chance | Guidance |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|----------|
0 | Routine | 0 | 0% | Anyone can do this basically every time.
1 |Simple | 3 | 15% |Most people can do this most of the time.
2 |Standard | 6 | 30% | Typical task requiring focus, but most people can usually do this.
3 | Demanding | 9 | 45% |Requires full attention; most people have a 50/50 chance to succeed.
4 |Difficult | 12 | 60% | Trained people have a 50/50 chance to succeed.
5 |Challenging | 15 | 75 % | Even trained people often fail.
6 |Intimidating | 18 | 90% | Normal people almost never succeed.
7 |Formidable | 21 | 105%| Impossible without skills or great effort.
8 |Heroic | 24 | 120% | A task worthy of tales told for years afterward.
9 |Immortal | 27 | 135% | A task worthy of legends that last lifetimes.
10 |Impossible | 30 | 150% | A task that normal humans couldn’t consider (but one that doesn’t breakthe laws of physics)

Character skills, favorable circumstances, or excellent equipment can decrease the difficulty of a task. For example, if a character is trained in climbing, she turns a difficulty 6 climb into a difficulty 5 climb. This is called easing the difficulty by one step (or just easing the difficulty, which assumes it’s eased by one step). If she is specialized in climbing, she turns a difficulty 6 climb into a difficulty 4 climb. This is called easing the difficulty by two steps. Decreasing the difficulty of a task can also be called simply easing a task. Some situations increase, or hinder, the difficulty of a task. If a task is hindered, it increases the difficulty by one step.

A skill is a category of knowledge, ability, or activity relating to a task, such as climbing, geography, or persuasiveness. A character who has a skill is better at completing related tasks than a character who lacks the skill. A character’s level of skill is either trained (reasonably skilled) or specialized (very skilled).

If you are trained in a skill relating to a task, you ease the difficulty of that task by one step. If you are specialized, you ease the difficulty by two steps. A skill can never ease a task’s difficulty by more than two steps.

Anything else that reduces difficulty (help from an ally, a particular piece of equipment, or some other advantage) is referred to as an asset. Assets can never ease a task’s difficulty by more than two steps.

You can also ease the difficulty of a given task by applying Effort. (Effort is described in more detail in Chapter 8: Rules of the Game.) To sum up, three things can ease a task’s difficulty: skills, assets, and Effort.

If you can ease a task so that its difficulty is reduced to 0, you automatically succeed and don’t need to make a roll.
