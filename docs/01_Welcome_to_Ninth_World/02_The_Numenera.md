
People with knowledge of the relics of older worlds divide them into three types: artifacts, cyphers, and oddities.

**ARTIFACTS** are large devices that typically can be used more than once to produce the same result. An artifact might be a belt that creates a shield of invisible force to protect the wearer or a flying skiff that carries people and cargo from one place to another. The term is almost always used for an item that has an obvious purpose—a weapon, a defense, a mode of transport, a means of communication or learning new information, a means of obtaining food or other necessities, and so forth. Artifacts make their users more powerful, or they make life easier or better.

**CYPHERS** are usually small, minor devices that most characters can coax a single effect from before they are depleted and become curiosities or decorations. They might include a quick injection designed to repair physical damage in a living creature or a handheld object that, when manipulated properly, becomes a weapon that explodes with tremendous force. However, cyphers are dangerous when gathered together because they create radiation and harmonic frequencies that are inimical to human life.

**ODDITIES** are the relics that are neither
cyphers nor artifacts. They serve no obvious
purpose but have strange functions that are
at least curious, if not downright entertaining.
Examples include a piece of glass in a metal
frame that shows peculiar images or a box
with three bells that ring at unpredictable
times. Not everything from the prior worlds
can be understood. In fact, much of it cannot


	Numenera items such as artifacts and cyphers add capabilities to the player character’s repertoire, but they are the purview of the game master. Very rarely does a player choose these items; they are discovered while exploring ancient ruins or overcoming other challenges of the Ninth World.
