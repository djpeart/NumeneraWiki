*The Ninth World is about discovering the wonders of the worlds that came before it, not for their own sake, but as the means to improve the present and build a future.*

There have been eight previous worlds. You may refer to them as ages, aeons, epochs, or eras, but it’s not wrong to think of each as its own individual world. Each former world stretched across vast millennia of time. Each played host to a species whose civilizations rose to supremacy but eventually died or scattered, disappeared or transcended. During the time that each world flourished, those who ruled it spoke to the stars, reengineered their physical bodies, and mastered form and essence, all in their own unique ways. 

Each left behind remnants. 

The Ninth World is built on the bones of the previous eight, and in particular the last four. Reach into the dust, and you’ll find that each particle has been worked, manufactured, or grown, and then ground back into drit—a fine, artificial soil—by the relentless power of time. Look to the horizon—is that a mountain, or part of an impossible monument to the forgotten emperor of a lost people? Feel that subtle vibration beneath your feet and know that ancient engines—vast machines the size of kingdoms—still operate in the bowels of the earth.

Each of the prior eight worlds, in its own way, is too distant, too different, too incomprehensible. Life today is too dangerous to dwell on a past that cannot be understood. The people excavate and study the marvels of the prior epochs just enough to help them survive in the world they have been given. They know that energies and knowledge are suspended invisibly in the air, that reshaped continents of iron and glass—below, upon, and above the earth—hold vast treasures, and that secret doorways to stars and other dimensions and realms provide power and secrets and death. They sometimes call it magic, and who are we to say that they’re wrong?

More often, however, when they find leftovers of the old worlds—the devices, the vast machine complexes, the altered landscapes, the changes wrought upon living creatures by ancient energies, the invisible nano-spirits hovering in the air in clouds called the iron wind, the information transmitted into the so-called datasphere, and the remnants of visitors from other dimensions and alien planets—they call these things the numenera. In the Ninth World, the numenera is both a boon and a bane. It makes life very different from any other time on Earth. 

In a southern part of the vast, singular continent of the Ninth World lies a cluster of settled lands collectively called the Steadfast. Although each of the kingdoms and principalities of the Steadfast has its own ruler, a leader known as the Amber Pope guides the Order of Truth, an organization of Aeon Priests that commands a great deal of respect in the region. Thus, the Amber Pope is likely the most powerful ruler in the Steadfast even though he does not govern a single square foot of land. The Order of Truth reveres the people of the past and their knowledge on a quasi-religious level of adoration and faith. It is a religion devoted to science.

Deeper in the wilds lies a region called the Beyond, where villages and communities are isolated and rare. Here, Aeon Priests still study the secrets of the past, but they do so cloistered in remote claves. These priests do little more than pay lip service to the Amber Pope, if that, and are not considered part of the Order of Truth. Like the regions in which they live, and the claves in which they work, they are isolated, islands unto themselves.

	Claves—small cloistered groups of Aeon Priests in the Beyond—can offer protection and resources for the communities that spring up around them. However, claves sometimes become so insular and focused on their work that they end up putting the community at risk with their strange experiments.
